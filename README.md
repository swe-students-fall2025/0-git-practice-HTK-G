The article that I found intersting is [How to Design a Hotel Booking System](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-design-a-hotel-booking-system-56ef18b6adfc)
by Leanne, Medium.com.

## Reflection

The reason that I selected this article was because I recently used Airbnb for booking a trip.

As a future Software Engineer, I force myself to disect techniques to see the structure of a software. I found this article especially easy to understand in terms of understanding a systematic way of building a hotel-booking system.

1. It shows you the initial requirement analysis.
2. It gives the system design for this application, and the corresponding API design and Formatting.
3. It shows how to increase the robustness of this system.

These steps of approach can be helpful in a job interview. I found it interesting to read and I learned how booking systems work in a engineering aspect.
